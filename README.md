# freeCodeCamp Personal Portfolio Webpage

This is my Personal Portfolio Webpage for freeCodeCamp's 5th and last [basic front end project](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage). I did a lot of research to end up with this design. Demo is also available [on codepen.io](https://codepen.io/macnick/full/bQMOBo). Below my photo there is a live indicator showing my progress at [codewars.com](http://codewars.com). Contact form and social buttons all point to me.
